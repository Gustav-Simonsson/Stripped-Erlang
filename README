Bash script for creating a small Erlang release.

Example:

wget http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B03-1.tar.gz
./minimal_erlang.sh -s -e otp_src_R15B03-1.tar.gz

Notes:
The script will unpack the Erlang/OTP tarball and build a Erlang release
from source. You may want to have checked that the build configuration step
works before running the script. 
See chapter 3.5 in http://www.erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/INSTALL.html

To speed things up:
export MAKEFLAGS=-jX
where X is number of logical cores + 2.

You can also manually remove unneeded OTP apps in the lib folder in the created
release directory.
